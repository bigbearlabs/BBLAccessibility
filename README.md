# BBLAccessibilityApp 

## A demo of current OS X Accessibility API techniques


Gathers source from extremely valuable repos, such as [Silica] and [NMTest001], to showcase how useful features of the OS X Accesibility API can be invoked.


    - [x] Getting information for windows for all appsfix
    - [x] Getting the selected text region
    - [x] Getting information for windows in the current space
    - [ ] Moving a window to another screen or space




This is for an app I'm building that manages working contexts on OS X. I wouldn't be able to make such a tool without valuable source that was open to explore, so I thought I'd share my findings with you all. Your pull requests, as well as requests for features or improvement, are very welcome.
